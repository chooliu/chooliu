### _**Hello!**_ ☀️
My name is Choo, a PhD Bioinformatics student at the University of California, Los Angeles.

My journey in computational biology begun as a molecular biologist (e.g., 10X Genomics) followed by statistical training (MS Biostatistics; Colorado School of Public Health / statistics consulting core).

These past lives have converged in my current research in the Luo Lab at UCLA (PI: Chongyuan Luo), where our group develops new multiomic single-cell and spatial assays. My research develops computational methods to extend these assays to large multi-donor studies, with a focus on statistical genetics tools for single-cell and epigenetic datasets.

### _**Selected Research Interests:**_
- single-cell & spatial biology, multi-‘omic integration, epigenetics, statistical genetics
- network analysis, multivariate models, non-parametrics, machine learning, causal inference
- environmental health equity, developmental origins of disease, psychiatric traits, neurodegeneration, aging

### _**Recent Highlights:**_
- A Single-Cell Atlas of DNA Methylation in Autism Spectrum Disorder Reveals Distinct Regulatory and Aging Signatures in Prefrontal Cortex. [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.17.660162v1)
- Integration of polygenic risk with single cell methylation profiles for depression. [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.11.642615v1)
- FastGxC: Fast and Powerful Context-Specific eQTL Mapping in Bulk and Single-Cell Data. [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.17.448889v2)

### _**Hobbies:**_
Clinical volunteering (mental health and harm reduction settings), media studies, internet history, botany, synthesizers and field recording, film noir, and immediately misplacing all of my pencils and pens.

**Yapping and learning about other folks' research is my favorite part of being in academia. Please reach out if you'd like to collaborate or grab a coffee!**
